# 🧱 Miner-Pose Dataset

The **Miner-Pose** dataset is a large-scale dataset designed for human pose estimation in underground mining environments. Unlike existing public datasets which are primarily collected under well-lit, above-ground conditions, **Miner-Pose** is specifically tailored to the unique challenges posed by underground mining scenarios. It includes **12,225 images** collected from real-world mining environments and re-annotated data from the **DsLMF+** dataset, providing valuable data for mining safety and pose estimation research.
